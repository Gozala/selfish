## 1.0.1 / 2015-04-03
  - Updated bower.json authors

## 1.0.0 / 2015-03-02

  - Mocha + should for testing
  - We now mess with the prototypes so we can call `new Foo()` instead of
      `Foo.new()`. This means that most of the calls that were made with `Foo`
      are now made with `Foo.prototype` except `extend` which is still made on
      the object and not on its prototype.
  - `instanceof` should now be working but this feature is not tested
